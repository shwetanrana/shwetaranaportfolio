    <h1>Understanding Churn Prediction</h1>
    <div class="key-points">
        <p>Churn prediction involves identifying at-risk customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions or close/abandon their accounts.</p>
        <p>A churn model works by passing previous customer data through a machine learning model to identify the connections between features and targets and make predictions about new customers.</p>
        <p>Identifying churn before it happens helps businesses take proactive action to retain customers. This includes targeted re-engagement campaigns, personalized customer education, and more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="key-points">
        <h2>What is churn prediction?</h2>
        <p>Customer churn prediction identifies which customers are at a high risk of canceling their subscription or abandoning your product.</p>
        <p>Churn prediction, therefore, tells you whether a customer will leave and why.</p>
    </div>
    
<div class="key-points">
    <h2>Understanding the churn prediction model</h2>
    <p>A churn prediction model is a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will likely churn. At a high level, predicting customer churn requires a detailed understanding of your customers.</p>
    <p>This understanding is derived by examining the historical data of your customers. A good churn prediction dataset will include multiple predictive features that describe your customer â€“ contract type, subscription price, etc.</p>

    <div class="key-points">
        <h2>Identifying Customer churn</h2><p>
        <ul>
            <li>How often is my service/product used?</li>
            <li>What features are customers using the most?</li>
            <li>What problems are customers solving with your tool?</li>
            <li>What are your clients hoping to achieve by choosing your service?</li>
            <li>How often do users renew their subscriptions?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="key-points">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Predicting churn before it occurs empowers businesses to mitigate customer attrition, drive up retention rates, and ultimately, bolster revenue growth.
